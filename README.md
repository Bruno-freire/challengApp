Challenge App
Welcome to Challenge App! This is a simple web application designed to manage challenges for candidates.

Overview
Challenge App is a web-based platform that allows users to participate in challenges. Users can register with their name, phone number, and email address. Once registered, they can start the challenge, which involves completing a task within a specified time limit. If the challenge is completed successfully, users are redirected to a candidate page where their registration details are displayed. If the challenge is unsuccessful, users are notified via a modal.
